Lingua::FeatureMatrix - Perl extension for configuring groups of
(e.g.) phonemes into feature groups

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Lingua::FeatureMatrix;

  # this example uses the module provided in the examples directory of
  # the distro; you'll want to create your own 'Eme' subclass or
  # modify 'Phone.pm' for yourself:

  use lib 'examples';
  use Phone;

  # construct a new feature-matrix from a dat file (here using dat
  # file same as example below)
  my $matrix =
    Lingua::FeatureMatrix->new(eme => Phone,
                               file => 'examples/phonematrix.dat');

  if ($matrix->matchesFeatureClass('EE', 'VOW')) {
    # EE is a "vow", bless this properly
    push @Pope::ISA, 'Catholic';
  }

  if (not $matrix->matchesFeatureClass('AA', 'AFF')) {
    # will be executed
    $deadman->walking();
  }

  if ($matrix->matchesFeatureClass('S', 'VOW')) {
    # won't happen
    map { $_->fly() } @pigs;
  }

  # silliness aside, you can also dump a filled-out matrix, with all
  # the implications spelled out, after loading it:
  print $matrix->dumpToText(), "\n";

  # you can also ask for a list of the emes that match a given object:
  print "the vowels are:\n",
    join ' ', $matrix->listFeatureClassMembers('VOW');
  print "the affricates are:\n",
    join ' ', $matrix->listFeatureClassMembers('AFF');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Lingua::FeatureMatrix> is a class for managing user-defined
feature-sets.  It provides an implementation of datafile parsing that
is generic and useful for anyone defining feature sets of symbols.

If you haven't read the L</Motivation> you might want to skip down to
it.

Featuresets are a common way of describing phonetics problems,
e.g. sound change behaviors, but may be useful to people solving other
problems as well. (The included C<Letter> class may, for example, be
useful in writing ligature rules -- if you find this useful for some
other application, please contact the author.)

Users must indicate what type of C<Eme> they are working with. In
fact, users will probably want to define their own. To do this, define
a subclass of C<Lingua::FeatureMatrix::Eme> and indicate that one as
the C<eme> parameter to the C<new()> method call.

=head2 Creating your own C<Eme> type

Users should not have to provide very much to construct their own
C<Lingua::FeatureMatrix::Eme> that supports all the features you're
interested in.

See L<Lingua::FeatureMatrix::Eme> for details on what's
required to properly subclass C<Lingua::FeatureMatrix::Eme>.

If you'd rather not follow through on all the details specified there,
you can use one of the two stubby subclasses C<Phone> and C<Letter>
provided in the C<examples/> directory of this distribution as a
jumping-off point. They too are documented, and have a loose licensing
condition for your unrestricted use (see the C<README>).

=head1 Tutorial

=head2 Vocabulary

To keep this system general, there are several important terms to understand:

TO DO: clarify this vocabulary intro

=over

=item eme

I use the word I<eme> to describe a single unit (one row of the
feature matrix.)

(Think I<phoneme> or I<grapheme>.)

=item implicature

Note these are language-specific. (TO DO: Give example here.)

(Think I<synchronic rule> or I<feature generalization>.)

=item feature class

(Think I<composite feature>.)

=item feature

(Think I<single bit of descriptive information>.)

=over

=item +

=item -

=item *

=back

=head2 Datafile format

You might want to begin by opening the C<phonematrix.dat> file or the
C<lettermatrix.dat> file included in the C<examples> directory of this
distribution.  These use the feature sets defined by C<Phone.pm> and
C<Letter.pm>, sample C<Eme> classes each also included in the same
directory.

First, some basic terms that make up the underlying grammar of these
datafiles:

=over

=item SIGN

Either C<+>, C<->, or C<*>, indicating the values of C<1>, C<0>, and
C<undef> respectively.

=item FEATURE

A case-sensitive text string like C<vow> indicating the name of the
C<Eme> feature. Always used with C<SIGN>.

=item FEATURESET

A complex grouping of one or more C<SIGN>C<FEATURE> pairs, surrounded
by C<[]>, like:

  [ +voice +fric +stop ]

=item PHONESYMBOL

a string of characters matching the C</\S+/> regular expression. This
is so widely accepting because of the large variety of phonetic
representation schemes available. Leaving this agnostic allows users
to use, e.g.:

(TO DO: include examples here):

=over

=item UTF-8 IPA symbols

=item Pronlex symbols

=item DARPAbet

=item SAMPA (aka IPA-for-ASCII)

=back

=back

Each line in the datafile should be considered an entire
statement. You'll find that the datafiles are made up of four kinds of
lines.  I<Comments>, I<Eme descriptions>, I<Implicatures>, and
I<feature classes>. Future versions of this module may include more
types of lines.

All lines are insensitive to whitespace, except for a I<Comment> line
(which isn't a I<Comment> at all unless there is no whitespace before
the '#').

=over

=item Comments

Any line beginning with a '#' is a comment, and the entire line is
ignored. Note if the '#' is I<not> the first character on a line, it
is not ignored.  This is the only place that whitespace is considered
in this grammar.

=item Eme descriptions

Any line which takes the form:

  PHONESYMBOL [ FEATURESET ]

For example,

  CH [ +stop +fric -voice ]
  J  [ +stop +fric +voice ]

  S [ +fric +sib +alv -voice ]
  Z [ +fric +sib +alv +voice ]

  SH [ +fric +sib +pal -voice ]
  ZH [ +fric +sib +pal +voice ]

  AA [ +low -back -front -tense ]

  IY [ +high +front +tense ]

It is acceptable, even encouraged, to "underspecify", that is, to
specify only those features which are needed to distinguish each phone
from its neighbors. If you do so, you will probably want to include
extra I<implicatures> though, since any C<Eme> that does not have all
its features specified after the I<implicatures> are processed will
invoke a C<carp>, which can get irritating.

=item Implicatures

Any line which takes the form

  ( FEATURESET => FEATURESET )

represents an I<Implicature>. The left C<FEATURESET> is called the
I<implier> and the right is called the I<implicant>.

As a special case, the C<FEATURESET>s involved may omit the C<[]> if
there is only one feature.

Implicatures allow the user to easily encode lots of different C<Eme>s
by encoding general "common sense" ideas. For example:

  ( +stop => +cons )

This means that an C<Eme> that is C<+stop> should be marked C<+cons>
by implication. (If this isn't an obvious implication, you may need
some phonology review, or you may be speaking Czech or Berber, and I
can't help you much with either problem.)

Note that more than one feature may imply the same setting, even to
the same C<Eme>. This is acceptable:

  ( +fric => +cons )
  ( +stop => +cons )

Both of these will apply to the following C<Eme> definition:

  CH [ +fric +stop -voice ]

Implicatures are one-way, or else the following wouldn't work:

  ( -tense => +vow )
  ( +tense => +vow )

(The two implications above indicate that if C<tense> is specified
I<at all>, then C<vow> should be C<+> by implication.)

An implicature need not set a single feature in the I<implicant>, nor is it
restricted to only one feature in the I<implier>.

  ( +sib => [ -voice +cons ] )
  ( [ +vow +cons ] => [ +glide ] )

Note that some implicatures can point out that a certain field had
better *not* be set (to either plus or minus); here we use the
'ungrammatical' C<*> marker:

  ( +cons => *tense )
  ( +vow => [ *stop *fric ] )

The first example above indicates that if C<cons> is true, then it is
I<ungrammatical> to specify a boolean value for C<tense>, and the
second indicates that if C<vow> is true, then it is I<ungrammatical>
to specify C<stop> or C<fric>. Note that the C<*fric> setting may not
be correct in languages other than English; that's the point of
putting all this in a configuration file.

Sometimes putting "obvious" things into implicatures can help catch
silly mistakes in your I<eme definitions>, especially when you can
specify ungrammaticality:

  # can't be both high and low (though [-high -low] is okay)
  # seems obvious here...
  ([+high] => [*low])
  ([+low] => [*high])

  # 200 lines later, by which point we've forgotten our decision
  # about the relationship between high and low...

  # the following eme definition croaks with a warning:
  EH [ +high +low -tense ]
  # should have been:
  # EH [ -high -low -tense ]

Using a C<*> value sets that C<feature> of the C<Eme> to be C<undef>,
rather than C<1> or C<0>, which is Perl's way of indicating "neither
false nor true, but the question is meaningless."

Note that for the time being, the implicatures are applied in the
order that they are submitted to the system.  Future editions may
involve automatic ordering of the implicatures (see L</Future
Improvements>).

=item Feature classes

  class AFF => [ +stop +fric ]
  class LOW_VOW => [ +low +vow ]

=back

=head2 Motivation

I need a tool that constructs objects representing the featureset of a
phoneme. The standard linguistic notation for this is (for the 'ch',
the 'eh', and the 's' sound in "chess"):

  CH [ +stop +fric -voice +palat +cons -vow ]
  EH [ +vow -cons -low -high +front -tense ]
  S  [ +cons +fric -stop +alv -voice ]

Furthermore, I may want to be able to refer to "feature classes", that
is, composite features like "affricate":

  class AFF [ +stop +fric ]

(this example would match 'CH' but not 'S' or 'EH').

To complicate things further, the list of primitive features is
linguistically controversial, the set of relevant classes varies from
language to language, even if you agree on the theoretical primitives,
and the choice of symbol set to represent the phoneme (IPA, Sampa,
DARPA-bet, etc) is varied and political.

Thus, in the finest Perl sense, TMTOWTDI.  The dimensions of
flexibility provided are:

You, the user, define what you want to be the featureset by
subclassing C<Lingua::FeatureMatrix::Eme>, distributed with this
module. An added side bonus is that you decide whether the base unit
is a C<Phone> or a C<Phoneme> (or, for that matter, a C<SoundUnit> or
a C<Letter> -- that subclass is I<your> module, and the goal is to
"[put] the focus not so much onto the problem to be solved, but rather
onto the person trying to solve the problem." (see
L<http://kiev.wall.org/~larry/pm.html|Perl and postmodernism>).

You, the user, define what the feature set is, and you define how the
phones distribute among those features, using the best of
I<Impatience> -- use the existing linguistic typographic conventions,
and this module takes care of constructing your objects for you. No
translating among conventions for us.

But let's go one step further. Languages include redundancy, and
sometimes it's boring (and not I<Lazy>) to have to specify yourself
that something that is C<[+stop]> is also C<[-vow +cons]>, especially
if you have to specify this for every single C<[+stop]> consonant.

So this module also introduces the concept of an I<implicature> -- I
can say, also in simple linguistically-familiar format, that

  ( [+stop] => [-vow +cons] )

and this will apply for all phones in the current dataset (unless I'm
speaking Berber, where this isn't necessarily true...). It's also I<Lazy>,
because the module also does the work of letting me know whether I
have forgotten to specify any of the features of a given phone:

  # probably missing a feature or six; would generate a warning.
  T [ +cons -vow ]

Along the way, we pick up some I<Hubris>:

=over

=item *

Doesn't apply just to phones anymore -- we can use it for letters and
ligatures, if we want.

=item *

It should be extensible to use these objects to connect to other
linguistics-style programs like C<Lingua::SoundChange>, not to
mention homebrew pronunciation algorithms like C<Lingua::Soundex>.
